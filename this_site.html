      <h2>THIS SITE</h2>
      <h6>(It's not much, but at least it's mobile compatable)</h6>
      <p>This is a simple website I made to learn more about HTML/CSS and thus far I'm quite happy with the results. I'm hosting this through GitHub Pages, which means its all static web-1 goodness.</p>
      <p>I originally made this for my <a href="https://neocities.org/">NeoCities</a>, but I figured I would turn it into a personal website with (hopefully) a semi-professional domain name and a link to my CV and everything in that department</p>
      <p>I wanted to make this something more personal, not just a template. I want to make this the wall I sign my name on within the greater public-toilet that is the internet.</p>
      <p>Enjoy</p>
