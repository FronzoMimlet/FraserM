      <h2>BIO</h2>
      <h6>(rough idea of who I am)</h6>
      <p>I’m a computing science student in the early years of an honors course. I’m enjoying it so far. Apart from that I mostly just dick about. Video games are a large part of that.</p>
      <p>Drawing is probably the hobby I’m most passionate about. I’ve been drawing for a couple years but I still have a ways to go before I’m confident in my abilities. Most of what I like to draw is character stuff. Mostly weird things. I might link my DeviantArt if I’m desperate, we’ll see.</p>
      <p>Music is another big thing for me. A mix of genres. I love finding strange music that I’ve never heard before.</p>
      <p>Apart from that, there’s not much else. I like house plants? I have, like 4 or 5 that just kind of exist. Of course I water them, and I like seeing them grow. But I don’t really have enough investment to name my plants. Well, apart from one. I have a terrarium from a 5-liter glass jar, full of ferns and leafy plants- He’s called Jarnald.</p>
      <p>I’m getting into photography, just a little bit though. I have one of my mums old cameras that I’ve loaded up with black and white film. Turns out it’s a pain to find anywhere that does black and white for 35mm, but I’ve got my first role back recently and I think it turned out quite well, so I think I’ll continue with it.</p>

      <p>Before this I’ve never really been interested in taking pictures. It was always something quite mundane and effortless, that was with a phone camera, where it does most of the work for you. You just need to be facing roughly the write direction and then the goblins in the box take care of the rest. Instance feedback.</p>
      <p>But analogue photography has an almost ritual-like quality to it. You need to decide carefully what to shot due to the limited amount of film. You need to check for exposure and depth of field. Lots of things. I’m completely new to it and don’t really have much of an idea what I’m talking about. But it’s still fun.</p>
      <p>I’m rambling so I’m just going to cut it here.</p>
