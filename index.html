        <p>Hi :-)</p>
        <p>My name is Fraser, and I'm currenty a 3rd year Comp Sci student. I made this website as a kind of base for anyone to gain a rough idea of who I am.</p>
        <p>I've been meaning to make a website for a while, but now that I find <abbr title="Winter 2023 to be exact, and yes I know I'm using this element wrong">time</abbr>, I figured I'd make something simple and functional.</p>
