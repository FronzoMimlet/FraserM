      <p>This is a simple website I made for fun. All of the HTML and CSS is my design, which I realize isn't saying too much. I figured I'd take advantage of the fact that the modern sleek look is easy to reproduce.</p>
      <p>I don’t really know what I’m going to do with the website. I’ve had one or two ideas but nothing concrete. I made this for the purpose of learning some basic HTML and CSS.
        Either way, I’ll probably figure out some stuff to put on here.
